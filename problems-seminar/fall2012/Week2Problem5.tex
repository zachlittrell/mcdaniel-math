1985 people attend a conference.

Fact 1. Given any 3 people at the conference, 
at least 2 speak a common language.

Fact 2. Everyone speaks at most 5 languages.

WTS that there is a language that at least 200 attendees speak.

Let $B_a = $ the set of attendees who do not share a common language with $a$.

Assume the contrary: there is no grouping of 200 attendees such that they speak the same language.

Let's take one attendee, $a$.\\
By Fact 2, $a$ knows at most 5 languages.\\
By our assumption, for each language $a$ knows, there can be no more than 200 other attendees who also know it $\Rightarrow$ a shares a language with at most $198*5=990$ attendees. Thus, $|B_a| \geq 994$.

Let $a' \in B_a$.\\
Also by Fact 2 and our assumption, $|B_{a'}| \geq 994$.\\
Suppose $\forall a'' \in B_{a'}\setminus \lbrace a \rbrace, 
          a'' \not\in B_a$\\
If we divide the miniumum number of members of $B_{a'}$ by the maximum
number of languages $a$ knows, i.e. $993/5$, we get 198.6 $\Rightarrow$ there is a language $a$ shares with 199 other attendees, but by our assumption, this cannot be so.\\
Thus, $\exists a'' \in B_{a'}\setminus \lbrace a \rbrace,
        a'' \in B_a$.

However, by Fact 1, two attendees in the group 
$\lbrace a, a', a'' \rbrace$ must share a language 
$\Rightarrow \Leftarrow$

Thus, there is a language that at least 200 attendees speak.
